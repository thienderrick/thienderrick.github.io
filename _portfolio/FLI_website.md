## 🎓 Pomona FLI Scholars Website Launch  

**Date:** Spring 2023 - PRESENT  
**Project Link:** <a href="[https://web.site](https://pomonaflischolars.us)">Pomona FLI Scholars Website</a>

### 🔹 About the Project  
As part of my commitment to preserving institutional memory and fostering a strong support network for first-generation, low-income (FLI) students, I developed and launched the **Pomona FLI Scholars website**. This platform serves as a **living archive**, connecting past and present FLI students through shared experiences, resources, and mentorship opportunities.  

### 🌱 Why I Did It  
Navigating college as a FLI student often comes with unique challenges—academic, financial, and social. I saw a need for a centralized hub where students could **find guidance, celebrate their successes, and feel seen**. By transferring and updating the archival database from Wix to WordPress, I aimed to create a **sustainable and easily accessible resource** that could continue supporting students beyond my time at Pomona.  

### 🔍 Key Features  
- 🏛 **Alumni Network:** A growing community of 50+ alumni offering insights and mentorship.  
- 📖 **Resource Archive:** Articles, advice, and institutional knowledge to empower FLI students.  
- 🔗 **Event Coordination:** Helping bridge the gap between current students and alumni through gatherings and networking opportunities.  

### 💡 Reflections  
This project reaffirmed my belief in the power of **community-driven initiatives**. It was deeply rewarding to see alumni engage with students, share their journeys, and contribute to a space that fosters **belonging and resilience**.  

### 🚀 What’s Next?  
I plan to continue updating the site with **new stories, opportunities, and ways to stay engaged**. If you’re a Pomona FLI alum or student interested in contributing, feel free to reach out!
