(We're about a full week into March, but I still want to say something and pretend I'm relishing in the month's novelty haha.)  

✨ **March is AmeriCorps Member Appreciation Month** ✨—and it was also this month a year ago when I left service. I want to take a moment to remember the team that made the experience so worthwhile.  

I'm incredibly honored to have had the opportunity to return to the school I served at and share my journey from a similar multicultural public high school in Arkansas. I even got to talk about the high-quality education I received through the QuestBridge National College Match, emphasizing that yes—a top-tier education **can** be accessible. It’s a full-circle moment for me, considering I used to be (and honestly still am) quite the troublemaker and “character.” 😅

💛 **Now, I want to dedicate this space to the amazing folks from Nathan Hale High School's City Year FY24 Team.**  

👉 **To Ms. Jazmin** – I appreciate the way you always remind me when I get out of pocket. 😂 Our latest addition to the team, but you truly completed it all. Hale is so lucky to have you as a teacher this year! Speaking of returning teachers...  

👉 **To Ms. Gaby** – I appreciate the way our minds would sync up and enable so much chaos. Something about Texan Chicanas, uy! 🤭 Hale has a great guardian to nourish our kiddos. TwT Ms. Gaby joined the team around the same time as Ms. Julie!  

👉 **To Ms. Julie** – I appreciate the deep, critical, and truly revolutionary conversations we shared. I know you missed this latest team reunion, but it’s because you’re out there making an impact on the legal side of things! 🏛️ Always cheering you on! Speaking of people missing out on reunions...  

👉 **To Ms. Emma** – I appreciate your care for students and your willingness to go on random adventures with me. 😆 I’ll miss seeing you on my weekly Winco grocery runs (no Winco here in Columbia 😭). I actually met Ms. Emma around the same time as Chris.  

👉 **To Mr. Chris** – I appreciate the unwavering support you’ve given me, even when I doubt myself (still working on that). 💙 And Chris’ right-hand man and our team leader...  

👉 **To Mr. Gavin** – I appreciate the authenticity you brought to the team. I’ll especially miss the "Gavin-isms" floating around. Just as expected, you're still serving—woo! 🚀 Your passion is unmatched. I’m still kinda shook we were Day-1's.  

👉 **Finally, to my fellow Day-1, Ms. Sari'ya Brown** – Thank you for being my literal anchor in this rollercoaster of a service term. 🎢 Despite my early departure, I wouldn’t have made it that far without a fantastic colleague and close friend. You are a natural connector with your students, and I’m so happy to see you continue your work in education.

🌎 **Oklahoma is so lucky** to have such an incredible group of educators, advocates, changemakers, and friends. To the **Hale High team**, I appreciate the memories we shared in (y)our year of service. ❤️
