# 🚀 2025-03: The Busiest Week of My Life  

As I soak in the last few months of being a fresh, young 24-year-old, I can't help but reflect on the absolute whirlwind that was this past week. Crazy. Hectic. Absolutely nonstop. But through all of it, I feel so incredibly lucky to be where I am today.  

None of this would be possible without my mom instilling in me the value of education, QuestBridge opening doors to a **tier-1 liberal arts college**, and the incredible people in my life cheering me on. Who would’ve thought that a queer little brown boy—who grew up homeless, raised by a single mother, bullied relentlessly, and a self-proclaimed troublemaker in high school—would become who I am today? Life has a funny way of surprising us.  

In just **one** week, I traveled to **Arkansas, Oklahoma, the University of Maryland, and Washington, D.C.**—all while juggling my current home base in **Columbia, Missouri**. ✈️📍

## 🎤 Friday, March 21st – Arkansas PBS Interview (Conway, AR)  

🎓 My former **quiz bowl** coach connected me with **Arkansas PBS**, where they were looking to profile past players. What an experience! I got to share my story—how quiz bowl gave me a sense of **liberation in learning**, my journey from an underdog to a liberal arts grad, and how I now juggle multiple roles like a true **jack-of-all-trades**.

## 🎬 Monday, March 24th – FX’s *The Sensitive Kind* Extra Filming (Tulsa, OK)  

🌟 So, I can officially say I was an **extra** in a TV series by **Sterlin Harjo**! And let me tell you, me and the other extras were **s c r e a m i n g** when he complimented our "extras" performance. (Our role? Playing queer friends meeting up outside a bar—if you know me, you know I wear my personality **on my sleeve** 💅).

## 🧠 Thursday, March 27th – Human Sentence Processing Conference (University of Maryland)  

📚 **My first intense academic conference—and I LOVED IT!**  

I was completely overstimulated (in the best way) by all the knowledge, research, and incredible people I got to talk with. This was also my **first** poster presentation, and I got so many compliments! 🎉  

💡 I networked with so many brilliant academics and got to pick their brains about the field. Walking away from this, I feel **more confident than ever** about where I want to take my research next.

## 🍽️ Friday, March 28th – Exploring Washington, D.C.  

🚎 The conference hooked us up with a **shuttle to Planet Word** (a must-visit for a language nerd like me!) and provided food & drinks from **Immigrant Food** (which, yes, is a brand—and their food was 🔥).

🏃‍♂️ After speed-walking through the exhibit (because time is a construct), I trekked over to **Your Only Friend** for food & drinks with one of my good friends from **Pomona’s Class of 2021**. I love knowing I have friends in every corner of the world. ❤

**This week was a blur, but it reminded me of something important:**  
I am living proof that the **kid who wasn’t supposed to "make it"** can carve out a path entirely his own.  

Here’s to more chaotic, exciting, and fulfilling weeks ahead! ✨
