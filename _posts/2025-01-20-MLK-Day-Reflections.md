## ✨ Reflections on Service in Honor of Martin Luther King Jr. ✨

Growing up, I always associated MLK Day with two things: learning about Dr. King’s profound impact as a civil rights leader and getting the day off from school. Back then, my understanding of his legacy was surface-level—important, but distant. The day was a break from schoolwork, a pause in the chaos of student life and dealing with puberty and identity.
It wasn’t until much later that I began to see how Dr. King’s vision tied into my own values and actions. Specifically, Service.

During my 2023-2024 service year with AmeriCorps, I started reflecting deeply on what service truly means. AmeriCorps carved out space for me to confront questions about my role in society, the systems I navigate, and the communities I serve. MLK Day became more than a day of remembrance; it became a call to action. In my case, today I unfortunately will be traveling back to mid-Missouri. However, this past weekend, I did serve in some capacity!

## 📚 Oklahoma Academic Bowl

Pictured below are two photos of me and Ms. Julie when we volunteered moderating for Oklahoma's Secondary Schools Activities Association Quiz Bowl regional tournament from 2024 and this year.

One of my most meaningful experiences during my AmeriCorps term came unexpectedly, in the library after school, where I stumbled into Academic Bowl practice. What began as a nostalgic visit turned into something much bigger.

There, I met a student scribbling chemistry formulas on a whiteboard—for fun. We got to talking, and I learned about the challenges they’d overcome to excel academically. They hadn’t considered applying to selective colleges, believing they weren’t an option. Naturally, I did what I do best: I encouraged them to "dream big."

Through Academic Bowl in Oklahoma, I found myself not only revisiting my own high school quiz bowl days but also serving as a mentor and advocate for students who reminded me of myself. Volunteering to moderate tournaments (alongside my fellow AmeriCorps member and friend for life Julie Kulla!), I shared stories about my college journey, my lab work, and the opportunities I’d found as a first-gen, low-income student. This year, we were invited back to moderate and judge again. I share pictures, taken essentially a year apart. Along the way, I seemed to gain a little fan club—shoutout to the players who said, “Derrick’s back!” when I walked into the room. 😊

This year, I noticed Southeast Asian students among the competitors. After a game, I introduced myself, shared my QuestBridge experience, and gave them my contact info. It felt like a full-circle moment—a chance to help students like I once was, sitting in those very seats nearly a decade ago.

## 🌟 Reflection on Service

The student I met through Academic Bowl didn’t end up becoming a QuestBridge finalist. But they’re still dreaming big—they’ve applied to selective schools, and we’re waiting on their decisions together. Their resilience reminds me why I serve: to help students, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, realize that their stories belong in spaces of opportunity.
I’ve carried this purpose into every role I’ve taken on. Whether volunteer moderating Academic Bowl in Tulsa Oklahoma, helping a family friend in my Arkansan hometown with their future QuestBridge application, to even the online "brainrot" Reddit forums, I’m always guided by the belief that someone’s dreams deserve to occupy space—and that with the right support, they can and WILL.

Today, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I reflect on service as an act of love and community. It’s about showing up—not perfectly, but wholeheartedly.
