# 👋 **Hi!** Welcome to my GitHub.io page, where I post the **potpourri** of my projects and ponderings.

🧠 My name is **Đerrick**, and I am currently a **lab manager** for the **Neuroscience of Education Research on Development (NERD) Lab** at the **University of Missouri** within the **Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences** at the **College of Health Sciences**. I work under **Dr. Laura M. Morett’s** supervision, exploring 🗣️ **second language acquisition**, particularly the role of **multimodal processing in lexical tone perception**. I'm ecstatic to dive into **Linguistics** from different perspectives, curating my **interdisciplinary training** for future graduate studies.

📚 **Academic Background**  
I completed my **secondary education** at a 🎓 **multicultural public high school** in **Springdale, Arkansas** before being named a 🏅 **QuestBridge Match Scholar** and attending 🎓 **Pomona College** in Claremont, California. My learning journey has taken me from studying **Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) labor leaders** across California to studying my **heritage language** at **Pitzer College, Hue University,** and the **Southeast Asian Studies Summer Institute (SEASSI)** at the **University of Wisconsin - Madison**. My work has been supported by **the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship** and the **Yidan Expendable Fund for Transformative Learning**.

✨ **Passions & Interests**  
- 💡 In my free time, I love **mentoring first-generation and/or low-income students** on navigating (selective) college admissions.  
- 📜 I'm also an **archivist** and 🎥 **micro-documentarian**, preserving and curating **diverse stories** through different **archival projects**—check them out under my **Portfolio** page!  
- 🌍 I'm passionate about **language learning** and **language conservation/revitalization efforts**! I can speak **Spanish** 🇪🇸 and **Vietnamese** 🇻🇳. I've also developed a constructed script for a future conlang I would like to incorporate my linguistics training into.
