# 👋 **Hi!** Welcome to my GitHub.io page, where I post the **potpourri** of my projects and ponderings.

🧠 My name is **Derrick**, and I am currently a **lab manager** for the Neuroscience of Education Research on Development <a href="https://sites.google.com/umsystem.edu/nerd-lab/home?authuser=0">(NERD) Lab</a> at the **University of Missouri** within the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences at the College of Health Sciences.

### 📚 **Academic Background**  
I completed my secondary education at a 🎓 multicultural public high school in **Springdale, Arkansas** before being selected as a 🏅 **QuestBridge Match Scholar** attending 🎓 **Pomona College** in Claremont, California. My journey has taken me to studying from Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) labor leaders across California to my heritage language at Pitzer College, Hue University, and the Southeast Asian Studies Summer Institute (SEASSI) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. My work has been supported by the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship and the Yidan Expendable Fund for Transformative Learning.

### ✨ **Passions & Interests**  
- 💡 In my free time, I love **mentoring first-generation and/or low-income students** on navigating (selective) college admissions, transitioning into college, and transitioning post-graduation. I volunteer with a few different organizations such as *Posse* and *QuestBridge* at different capacities.
- 📜 I'm also an artist, archivist, and advocate, preserving and curating diverse stories through different artistic archival projects—check them out under my Portfolio page!  
- 🌍 I'm passionate about language learning and language conservation/revitalization efforts! I can speak Spanish 🇪🇸 and Vietnamese 🇻🇳. I've also developed a constructed script for a future conlang I would like to incorporate my linguistics training into. Otherwise, my academic interests includes Southeast Asian Historical Linguistics, Huế Dialect & Chữ Nôm, (Lexical) Tone Perception/Production, and Sociolinguistics.
