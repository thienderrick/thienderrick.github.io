# 👋 **Hi!** Welcome to my GitHub.io page, where I post the **potpourri** of my projects and ponderings.

🧠 My name is **Derrick**, and I am currently a **lab manager** for the Neuroscience of Education Research on Development <a href="https://sites.google.com/umsystem.edu/nerd-lab/home?authuser=0">(NERD) Lab</a> at the **University of Missouri** within the **Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences** at the **College of Health Sciences**.

### 📚 **Academic Background**  
I completed my secondary education at a 🎓 multicultural public high school in **Springdale, Arkansas** before being named a 🏅 **QuestBridge Match Scholar** and attending 🎓 **Pomona College** in Claremont, California. My journey has taken me to studying from Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) labor leaders across California to my heritage language at Pitzer College, Hue University, and the Southeast Asian Studies Summer Institute (SEASSI) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. My work has been supported by the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship and the Yidan Expendable Fund for Transformative Learning.

### ✨ **Passions & Interests**  
- 💡 In my free time, I love **mentoring first-generation and/or low-income students** on navigating (selective) college admissions and transitioning into college. I volunteer with a few different organizations such as Posse and QuestBridge
- 📜 I'm also an **artist**, **archivist**, and **advocate**, preserving and curating **diverse stories** through different artistic archival projects—check them out under my **Portfolio** page!  
- 🌍 I'm passionate about **language learning** and **language conservation/revitalization efforts**! I can speak **Spanish** 🇪🇸 and **Vietnamese** 🇻🇳. I've also developed a constructed script for a future conlang I would like to incorporate my linguistics training into.
