# As You May Know, I Consider Myself an **Artist** First.

![Profile Picture of Derrick Against a Textile Background](/images/art_Profile_Picture.jpeg)

I've always loved to express myself through some type of art form. I joined the Art Club in Middle School and continued so in High School where I also took AP and IB Art courses. At Pomona, I would take a couple of art and film-making classes that would further cement my work in the theme of documentation. Here is a collection of the many creative projects I've produced from my childhood to present day.

### Denim Aprons #1 & #2
**Date:** Spring 2023 & Fall 2023

My 2D Design Professor taught another separate course Screen Printing where my friend Alicia had taken. In the screen printing room, there were these denim aprons that made me wonder... I was also taking Fiber Arts and learning about the horrifying fast fashion industry and reconciling with the massive waste of jeans and denim among many other fabrics. So, I took the thrown/donated jeans and re-purpose them into what you see today!

The second denim apron was a gift to my friend from high school who has kids now! I added pops of pink from pink denim shorts I use to own.

And here's the behind the scenes of making the second base fabric!
### Wallet from Denim Scraps

Okay, I'm particularly proud of this one. I recycled the larger scraps of denim I had into a pattern and made a wallet out of it. An additional layer of that "woah" factor is that I re-purposed this crotch zipper from a pair of purple and indigo shorts. I think of this piece as queer art as it playfully leans into the uncomfortable unzipping of the crotch zipper to access the inside of the wallet. There's a lot of meaning here that I'm hoping to convey, even themes on monetary value and materialism.
